Description: This permutation based hypothesis test, suited for several types of data 
    supported by the estimateNetwork function of the bootnet package (Epskamp & Fried, 2018), 
    assesses the difference between two networks based on several invariance measures (network 
    structure invariance, global strength invariance, edge invariance, several centrality 
    measures, etc.). Network structures are estimated with l1-regularization. The Network 
    Comparison Test is suited for comparison of independent (e.g., two different groups) and 
    dependent samples (e.g., one group that is measured twice). See van Borkulo et al. (2021),
